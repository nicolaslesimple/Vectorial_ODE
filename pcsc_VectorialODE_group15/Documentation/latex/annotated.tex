\section{Class List}
Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\textbf{ Bashforth} \\*Class allowing a more precise definition of one of the O\+DE solvers technics which is Adam-\/\+Bashforth method. This is an abstract class as before because the method Solve\+Vectorial\+O\+DE is virtual and it will be defined in different ways in the inherited classes. The different Adam-\/\+Bashforth method correspond to the different order we use to solve the system }{\pageref{class_bashforth}}{}

\item\contentsline{section}{\textbf{ Input} \\*Class allowing the saving of all the variables to define the system we want to solve. In fact, it takes as input variable (integer or double)\+: Timestep, Dimension, Order, Number\+Steps, Write\+Output\+Timestep. Moreover, \doxyref{Input}{p.}{class_input} object needs 3 matrix to define the system \+: Initial\+Condition\+Matrix, Coefficient\+Matrix, Function\+Matrix. Matrix are defined to be vector of vector of double. \doxyref{Input}{p.}{class_input} variables are given to the input class by the constructor. The other methods are getter allowing the access to theses private attributes }{\pageref{class_input}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\textbf{ Runge\+Kutta} \\*Class allowing a more precise definition of one of the O\+DE solvers technics which is Runge-\/\+Kutta method. This is an abstract class as before because the method Solve\+Vectorial\+O\+DE is virtual and it will be defined in different ways in the inherited classes. The different Runge-\/\+Kutta method correspond to the different order we use to solve the system }{\pageref{class_runge_kutta}}{}

\item\contentsline{section}{\textbf{ Solution} \\*This class allows the saving in the memory and the writing in a output file of the solution of the O\+DE system. The constructor need the input object defining the system to create a consistent format for the solution. In this class, method allowing the retrieve, the modification and the writing of the solution are implemented. The attributes of this class are the the solution matrix and two integer defining the size of this solution }{\pageref{class_solution}}{}
